## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security is of utmost importance, and we appreciate the cooperation of the community in identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security vulnerability in the [Project Name] project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to assess and address it.

2. **Inform the Maintainers**: Report the vulnerability to the project maintainers by sending an email to [skatim@yahoo.com](mailto:skatim@yahoo.com). Please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any related information.

3. **Use Encryption**: If possible, encrypt your email communication using the project's PGP key or encryption method. Contact the maintainers for details.

4. **Responsible Disclosure**: We follow a responsible disclosure process and will work with you to address the issue. Once the issue is resolved, you may be credited for your responsible disclosure, if you wish.

5. **Cooperate**: Please work with the maintainers to verify and test any security patches or fixes applied.

6. **Public Disclosure**: The maintainers will work to resolve the issue promptly. Once the issue is resolved and a fix is available, a security advisory will be published with full details, and you may be acknowledged if you have requested it.

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and will make all reasonable efforts to address and resolve them in a timely manner. Your cooperation in responsible disclosure is highly appreciated.
